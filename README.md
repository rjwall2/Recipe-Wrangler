### A recipe manager for people who cook with dietary limitations

This application allows for the input of recipes into a personal 
database, which can then be filtered in various ways.

Possible filters include:

- The exclusion of ingredients (e.g,does not have peanuts)

- By diet (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, ketogenic)

- By time (e.g, under 20 minutes)


I was interested in building this application due to my personal 
experience with allergenic, and voluntary limitations on my 
diet. I am allergic to peanuts, and am pseudo vegetarian. While I 
can cook for myself, sometimes it is hard for others to know 
what they can cook for me. With this application one would be 
able to sort their recipes by exclusion of ingredients (for
people with allergies) or by diet,
from a personal database of recipes.

###Phase 4: Task 2

Incorporated a map field in the RecipeCollection class that
stores the instructions of recipe. The map was used in the gui,
to allow the user to access the instructions of a recipe by inputting
the recipe's name
